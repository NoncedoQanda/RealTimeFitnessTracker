## Introduction

### Project Title
Real-Time Fitness Tracker

### Domain
Health & Fitness – This system operates in the domain of personal health and wellness, focusing on real-time monitoring and management of physical activity. It targets individuals who engage in exercise, ranging from casual walkers to dedicated athletes, and integrates with modern mobile technology to provide actionable insights.

### Problem Statement
Many fitness enthusiasts lack immediate, accurate feedback during workouts, making it difficult to adjust their efforts in real time or track progress effectively. Existing solutions often provide delayed data or require cumbersome manual input, reducing their utility. The Real-Time Fitness Tracker addresses this by delivering instant metrics—such as heart rate, calorie burn, and exercise duration—directly to the user, enhancing training efficiency and motivation.

### Individual Scope
This project is feasible for an individual developer within the assignment’s timeframe. It leverages existing mobile device sensors (e.g., accelerometer, heart rate monitor) and widely available APIs, reducing the need for custom hardware or complex infrastructure. The system requires a straightforward mobile app for data collection and display, paired with a lightweight backend for storage and processing—tasks manageable with basic programming skills and standard development tools like GitHub, Markdown, and a mobile framework (e.g., Flutter or React Native). The scope is limited to core fitness tracking features, ensuring completion without overwhelming resources.
