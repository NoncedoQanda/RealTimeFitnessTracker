# Branch Protection Rules for `main`

## Why These Rules Matter
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Requiring at least one reviewer ensures code quality by catching errors and enforcing standards before merging.
- **Status Checks**: Requiring passing tests prevents buggy code from reaching production, maintaining stability.
- **No Direct Pushes**: Forcing changes through PRs ensures all code is reviewed and tested, reducing the risk of unvetted changes breaking the project.
- **Linear History**: (Optional) Keeps the commit history clean, making it easier to track changes and debug issues.

These rules align with industry best practices, ensuring robust quality control and collaboration.
