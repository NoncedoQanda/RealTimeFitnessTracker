### Project Name: Fitness Tracker in Real Time

### Domain 
Health & Fitness: With an emphasis on real-time physical activity monitoring and management, this system functions within the realm of individual health and wellness. It targets those who exercise, from infrequent walkers to serious athletes, and it connects with contemporary mobile technologies to deliver useful insights.

### Problem Statement
During workouts, many fitness lovers do not receive prompt, precise feedback, which makes it challenging to adequately track progress or modify their efforts in real time. The usefulness of existing solutions is diminished since they frequently deliver delayed data or necessitate laborious manual input. In order to improve training effectiveness and motivation, the Real-Time Fitness Tracker provides users with immediate indicators, like heart rate, calorie burn, and activity time.


### Personal Scope
An lone developer can complete this project within the allotted time. It eliminates the need for specialized hardware or intricate infrastructure by utilizing readily accessible APIs and sensors included in mobile devices, such as heart rate monitors and accelerometers. Basic programming knowledge and common development tools like GitHub, Markdown, and a mobile framework (like Flutter or React Native) can handle the system's requirements for a simple mobile app for data collecting and presentation and a lightweight backend for processing and storage. To ensure completion without taxing resources, the scope is restricted to essential fitness tracking elements.
